## Architecture

This is a personal academic website built with **SvelteKit 2.x** and **Svelte 5**, deployed on **Vercel**.

### Dual Front Page Design

The site has two different homepage designs that are randomly served:
- `/1` - Classic academic/professional design (85% traffic)
- `/2` - SNES retro gaming theme (15% traffic)

The root route (`/`) performs a server-side redirect in `src/routes/+page.server.ts`. Each design has its own header component:
- `src/lib/header/Header.svelte` - Standard header with squiggly underline animation
- `src/lib/header/SNESHeader.svelte` - Retro pixel-style header

The `hideStandardHeader` store (`src/lib/stores/headerVisibility.ts`) controls which header displays.

### Key Sections

- **CV** (`/cv`) - Academic curriculum vitae with publications, grants, teaching. Data-driven from `src/lib/cv/` components and `src/routes/cv/cv.json`.
- **Hue Hunter** (`/huehunter`) - Installable PWA color guessing game. Game logic in `src/lib/huehunter/`, with persistent history via `guessHistoryStore.ts`.
- **Blog** (`/p`) - Markdown posts via mdsvex. Posts live in `src/posts/`, list generated by `scripts/generate-post-list.js` at build time.

### UI Components

Uses shadcn-style components based on **bits-ui** located in `src/lib/components/ui/`. CSS uses **TailwindCSS** with custom theme variables defined in `tailwind.config.js` and `src/app.postcss`.

### API Routes

- `/api/random-color` - Returns random color data
- `/api/random-word` - Returns random unusual words

## Session Completion

Before ending a session, always:
1. Run `bd sync` to commit beads changes
2. Commit code changes
3. `git push` - work is not complete until pushed
