Considered purely logically, the totality of compossibilities of a particular property\u2014the totality of possible coinstantiations with other properties\u2014may be called the logical form of that property. It should also be noted that while the logical form of a property allows for its coinstantiation with a whole host of other properties, it does not allow for coinstantiation with more than one property of a particular type at any one time. Such multiple coinstantiation is excluded as a matter of logic. For instance, and continuing with the preceding example, while the property green may be coinstantiated with the properties soft and hard respectively, it cannot be coinstantiated with each of these at one and the same time because the one logically excludes the other."
