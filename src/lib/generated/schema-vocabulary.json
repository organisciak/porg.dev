The \"2012 London Olympics\" can be presented both as an [[Event]] in the series \"Olympic Games\", and as an [[EventSeries]] that included a number of sporting competitions as Events. The nature of the association between the events in an [[EventSeries]] can vary, but typical examples could include a thematic event series (e.g. topical meetups or classes), or a series of regular events that share a location, attendee group and/or organizers. EventSeries has been defined as a kind of Event to make it easy for publishers to use it in an Event context without worrying about which kinds of series are really event-like enough to call an Event. In general an EventSeries may seem more Event-like when the period of time is compact and when aspects such as location are fixed, but it may also sometimes prove useful to describe a longer-term series as an Event.","parents":["Event","Series"],"hierarchy":["Thing","Event","EventSeries"],"children":[],"isPending":true,"url":"https://schema.org/EventSeries"},"BroadcastService":{"name":"BroadcastService","description":"A delivery service through which content is provided via broadcast over the air or online.","parents":["Service"],"hierarchy":["Thing","Intangible","Service","BroadcastService"],"children":["RadioBroadcastService"],"isPending":false,"url":"https://schema.org/BroadcastService"},"AllocateAction":{"name":"AllocateAction","description":"The act of organizing tasks/objects/events by associating resources to it.","parents":["OrganizeAction"],"hierarchy":["Thing","Action","OrganizeAction","AllocateAction"],"children":["AcceptAction","AssignAction","AuthorizeAction","RejectAction"],"isPending":false,"url":"https://schema.org/AllocateAction"},"SpecialAnnouncement":{"name":"SpecialAnnouncement","description":"A SpecialAnnouncement combines a simple date-stamped textual information update with contextualized Web links and other structured data. It represents an information update made by a locally-oriented organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers, community groups, police, local government. For work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related markup see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#). The motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the [Coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic), and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org expect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges from use. In addition to our usual [Github entry](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490), feedback comments can also be provided in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#). While this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like [CAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol), although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover the kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency situation. Several kinds of information can be provided: We encourage the provision of \"name\", \"text\", \"datePosted\", \"expires\" (if appropriate), \"category\" and \"url\" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for \"category\" where possible, most ideally as a well known URL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20\\_coronavirus\\_pandemic\" or \"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910\". For many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline description, use a [[WebContent]] type, and provide the url as a property of that, alongside at least a simple \"[[text]]\" summary of the page. It is unlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously. We expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, [[openingHours]], [[Event]], [[FAQPage]] etc. By linking to those pages from a [[SpecialAnnouncement]] you can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the [[category]] property of the [[SpecialAnnouncement]]. Many [[SpecialAnnouncement]]s will relate to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations. Use [[spatialCoverage]] for the region, and [[announcementLocation]] to indicate specific [[LocalBusiness]]es and [[CivicStructure]]s. If the announcement affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library closure that serves an entire region), use both [[spatialCoverage]] and [[announcementLocation]]. The [[about]] property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus of the announcement. We now recommend using [[about]] only for representing non-location entities (e.g. a [[Course]] or a [[RadioStation]]). For places, use [[announcementLocation]] and [[spatialCoverage]]. Consumers of this markup should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of [[about]] for locations too. The basic content of [[SpecialAnnouncement]] is similar to that of an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)) feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be shared by posting [[SpecialAnnouncement]] updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed with the [[webFeed]] property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline [[DataFeed]] object, with [[encodingFormat]] providing media type information, e.g. \"application/rss+xml\" or \"application/atom+xml\".","parents":["CreativeWork"],"hierarchy":["Thing","CreativeWork","SpecialAnnouncement"],"children":[],"isPending":true,"url":"https://schema.org/SpecialAnnouncement"},"MedicalGuideline":{"name":"MedicalGuideline","description":"Any recommendation made by a standard society (e.g. ACC/AHA) or consensus statement that denotes how to diagnose and treat a particular condition.

This often includes perspectives from multiple viewpoints on a particular issue (distinguishing news reports from public relations or propaganda). News reports in the [[ReportageNewsArticle]] sense de-emphasize the opinion of the author, with commentary and value judgements typically expressed elsewhere.

The properties [[numConstraints]] and [[constraintProperty]] are used to specify which of the populations properties are used to specify the population. Note that the sense of \"population\" used here is the general sense of a statistical population, and does not imply that the population consists of people. For example, a [[populationType]] of [[Event]] or [[NewsArticle]] could be used. See also [[Observation]], where a [[populationType]] such as [[Person]] or [[Event]] can be indicated directly.

The usage pattern for [[StatisticalVariable]] is typically expressed using [[Observation]] with an explicit [[populationType]], which is a type, typically drawn from Schema.org. Each [[StatisticalVariable]] is marked as a [[ConstraintNode]], meaning that some properties (those listed using [[constraintProperty]]) serve in this setting solely to define the statistical variable rather than literally describe a specific person, place or thing. For example, a [[StatisticalVariable]] Median_Height_Person_Female representing the median height of women, could be written as follows: the population type is [[Person]]; the measuredProperty [[height]]; the [[statType]] [[median]]; the [[gender]] [[Female]]. It is important to note that there are many kinds of scientific quantitative observation which are not fully, perfectly or unambiguously described following this pattern, or with solely Schema.org terminology. The approach taken here is designed to allow partial, incremental or minimal description of [[StatisticalVariable]]s, and the use of detailed sets of entity and property IDs from external repositories.

[[QuantitativeValue]]: Use this for incentives based on price (either raw amount or percentage-based). For a raw amount example, \"You can claim $2,500 - $7,500 from the total cost of installation\" would be represented as the following: { \"@type\": \"QuantitativeValue\", “minValue”: 2500, “maxValue”: 7500, \"unitCode\": \"USD\" } [[QuantitivateValue]] can also be used for percentage amounts. In such cases, value is used to represent the incentive’s percentage, while maxValue represents a limit (if one exists) to that incentive. The unitCode should be 'P1' and the unitText should be '%', while valueReference should be used for holding the currency type. For example, \"You can claim up to 30% of the total cost of installation, up to a maximum of $7,500\" would be: { \"@type\": \"QuantitativeValue\", \"value\": 30, \"unitCode\": \"P1\", \"unitText\": \"%\", “maxValue”: 7500, “valueReference”: “USD” } [[UnitPriceSpecification]]: Use this for incentives that are based on amounts rather than price. For example, a net metering rebate that pays $10/kWh, up to $1,000: { \"@type\": \"UnitPriceSpecification\", \"price\": 10, \"priceCurrency\": \"USD\", \"referenceQuantity\": 1, \"unitCode\": \"DO3\", \"unitText\": \"kw/h\", \"maxPrice\": 1000, \"description\": \"$10 / kwh up to $1000\" } [[LoanOrCredit]]: Use for incentives that are loan based. For example, a loan of $4,000 - $50,000 with a repayment term of 10 years, interest free would look like: { \"@type\": \"LoanOrCredit\", \"loanTerm\": { \"@type\":\"QuantitativeValue\", \"value\":\"10\", \"unitCode\": \"ANN\" }, \"amount\":[ { \"@type\": \"QuantitativeValue\", \"Name\":\"fixed interest rate\", \"value\":\"0\", }, ], \"amount\":[ { \"@type\": \"MonetaryAmount\", \"Name\":\"min loan amount\", \"value\":\"4000\", \"currency\":\"CAD\" }, { \"@type\": \"MonetaryAmount\", \"Name\":\"max loan amount\", \"value\":\"50000\", \"currency\":\"CAD\" } ], } In summary: Use [[QuantitativeValue]] for absolute/percentage-based incentives applied on the price of a good/service. Use [[UnitPriceSpecification]] for incentives based on a per-unit basis (e.g. net metering).
