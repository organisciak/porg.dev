The American Library Association has announced the **2026 Youth Media Award winners**. This post includes the winners *and* honor books, grouped by award, with covers, short descriptions, and quick links to Amazon, Bookshop.org, and Libby. Winners are highlighted in gold. Libby searches are library-specific, so the Libby button opens Libby where you can select your library and search.

For the full official list (including non-book awards), see the [ALA announcement](https://www.ala.unikron.com/).
