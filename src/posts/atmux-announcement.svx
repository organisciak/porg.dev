The short version: I wanted tmux to feel smoother for project- and agent-based flows.

So I built **atmux** to do one practical thing well: make project-scoped tmux sessions easy to start, easy to revisit, and easy to operate while you’re actually coding.

It's not a framework, and not a platform. Just a tool on top of tmux that removes repetitive setup friction.

<AtmuxInterfaceTour autoplay={true} intervalMs={6400} />

<AtmuxFeatureFlip slides={featureSlides} intervalMs={5600} autoplay={true} />

## The Motivation

I kept repeating the same ritual every time I context-switched:

1. open tmux
2. split panes again
3. start the same agents again
4. try to remember where I left off

That was fine for one project. It was annoying for three. It was brutal for ten.

`atmux` is my attempt to make that loop calmer and faster. `tmux` already has great quality-of-life features on top of its windowing model, like mouse mode and shell autocomplete (I haven't typed beyond `tmux att` in a decade). I wanted to expand on those UI conveniences: mouse-enabled session switching and attaching, easier sending of input to panes, and config support so a directory can start with standard windows and panes (for me, that's usually `pnpm dev`, `build:watch`, or local emulators).

## What atmux Is Good At

- **Project identity:** each repo maps to a predictable session name.
- **Session memory:** active + recent workflows are first-class, so interruptions are cheap.
- **Operational control:** browse and send commands without constantly switching windows.
- **Low-friction customization:** one `.agent-tmux.conf` per project for pane layouts, plus optional global defaults.

## Why the Interface Looks This Way

I care a lot about tools that stay understandable under stress.

So the interface choices are intentionally boring in the best way:

- obvious commands (`atmux`, `atmux sessions`, `atmux browse`)
- list-first navigation patterns
- plain text output you can copy into docs, issues, and chats

And because sharing matters, there’s now path-hiding support in list output for screenshot-safe examples.

## Configuration That Sticks

`atmux onboard` is the fast way to set your default agent setup once.

After that, you can save preferred pane/window layouts in config files:

- global defaults: `~/.config/atmux/config`
- per-project overrides: `.agent-tmux.conf` (create with `atmux init`)

That combo is where the tool starts feeling personal: your defaults everywhere, plus project-specific pane layouts where they matter.

## A Quick Try

Install from the Homebrew tap, then bootstrap your defaults:

```bash
brew tap organisciak/tap
brew install atmux
cd ~/projects/my-app
atmux onboard
atmux
```

Then:

```bash
atmux sessions
atmux browse
atmux recents
```

## Yes, it's opinionated and vibe-coded 

If you want to follow along or contribute, the repo is here:

One final note: with Claude Code, Codex, and other agents, most of us end up building our own workflow tooling.

So if this exact setup doesn’t fit your stack, that’s fine. The useful move might be to branch it, tweak it, and make it yours.

It's being adapted to my opinions through non-stop^ dogfooding; ^seriously, I have to touch grass. The current roadmap is more remote workflow attention. That may not be what you need, and that's fine - fork it!

I’m excited about this one because it’s small, concrete, and easy to adapt.
